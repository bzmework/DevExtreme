DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Charts are jQuery-powered server-side charting controls that enable you to transform data into an eye-catching and elegant visual representation. In addition to the common line, bar, and pie charts, the collection includes such specialized charts as treemap, bubble chart, polar and radar charts, and many more. You can configure each chart with Razor C\# or Razor VB syntax, and use them in MVC views as well as in Razor Pages (introduced in .NET Core 2.0).
