DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Editors is a set of jQuery-powered server-side controls for data editing. This set includes TextBox, Calendar, DateBox, Switch, and many others. Each editor supports strongly-typed HTML helpers (see Validation demo), which provides client-side validation based on Data Annotations by default, and can be configured with Razor C\# or Razor VB syntax. In addition, DevExtreme Editors can be used in Razor Pages (introduced in .NET Core 2.0).
