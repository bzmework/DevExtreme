Area series can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;clearly emphasize change in&nbsp;values. In&nbsp;this example, you can switch between the _area_, _stacked area_ and _full-stacked area_ series types. _Stacked area_ series help visualize multiple series and compare the manner in&nbsp;which each series contributes to&nbsp;the total aggregate value for specific arguments. _Full-stacked area_ series help compare the percentage value of&nbsp;multiple area series for each argument.
