In&nbsp;this demo, the **candle stick** series displays variations in&nbsp;stock price throughout the course of&nbsp;a&nbsp;given day. Each point consists of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rectangle (body) whose bottom and topmost values correspond to&nbsp;the opening and closing price of&nbsp;a&nbsp;stock. A&nbsp;vertical line (shadow, wick or&nbsp;tail) displays the high and low price for the stock. If&nbsp;the stock closes higher than its opening price, no&nbsp;color fills its body and if&nbsp;the stock closes lower than its opening price, a&nbsp;color fill is&nbsp;applied.
