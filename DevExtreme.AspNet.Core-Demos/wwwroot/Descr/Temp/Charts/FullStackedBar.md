This demo illustrates the use of&nbsp;the _full-stacked bar_ series and how you can compare the percentage value of&nbsp;multiple bar series for each argument. The height of&nbsp;each bar always equals 100%. The value axis is&nbsp;continuous and displays a&nbsp;range between 0&nbsp;and 100%. Pause over a&nbsp;bar to&nbsp;see bar tooltips.
