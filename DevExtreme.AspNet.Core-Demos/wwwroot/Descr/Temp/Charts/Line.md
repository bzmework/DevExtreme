Line chart series types help visualize data trends over specified intervals. In&nbsp;this example, you can switch between the _line_, _stacked line_ and _full-stacked line_ series types. _Stacked line_ series help visualize multiple series and compare the manner in&nbsp;which each series contributes to&nbsp;the total aggregate value for specific arguments. _Full-stacked line_ series help compare the percentage value of&nbsp;multiple line series for each argument.
