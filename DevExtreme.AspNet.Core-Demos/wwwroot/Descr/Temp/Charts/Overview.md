DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Charts is an ultimate set of jQuery-powered charting controls that you can use in Razor C\# and Razor VB views. This set includes such widespread charts as line, area, bar, pie, as well as more task-specific charts, like funnel, treemap, polar, radar, and more. Support for lambda expressions makes the configuration process fluent and natural.
