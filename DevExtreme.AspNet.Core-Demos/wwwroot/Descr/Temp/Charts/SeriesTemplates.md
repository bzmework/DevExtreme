In&nbsp;this example, data for series is&nbsp;provided in&nbsp;a&nbsp;peculiar manner. Each object in&nbsp;the data source represents a&nbsp;point in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single series. To&nbsp;define series in&nbsp;this case, use the **seriesTemplate** object where you need to&nbsp;specify the data field providing series names and custom settings for a&nbsp;given series. Settings common to&nbsp;all series must be&nbsp;set within the **commonSeriesSettings** object. Providing data in&nbsp;this manner is&nbsp;useful when the number of&nbsp;points within a&nbsp;single series changes over time.
