In&nbsp;this example, side-by-side mode for the _full-stacked bar_ series type is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;group bar series based on&nbsp;their **stack** property value. Bar series with common characteristics are displayed and stacked in&nbsp;one column. Point values are converted to&nbsp;a&nbsp;percentage, and the height of&nbsp;the resulting column is&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;100%. The value axis is&nbsp;continuous and displays a&nbsp;range between 0&nbsp;and 100%.
