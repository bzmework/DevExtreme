Spline series types, like line series types, help visualize data trends over specified intervals. However, splines help &laquo;smooth&raquo; individual lines that connect data points. In&nbsp;this example, you can switch between the _spline_, _stacked spline_ and _full-stacked spline_ series types. _Stacked spline_ series help visualize multiple series and compare the manner in&nbsp;which each series contributes to&nbsp;the total aggregate value for specific arguments. _Full-stacked spline_ series help compare the percentage value of&nbsp;multiple spline series for each argument.
