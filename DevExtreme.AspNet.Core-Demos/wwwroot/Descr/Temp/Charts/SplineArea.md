Spline area series, like area series, are used to&nbsp;clearly emphasize change in&nbsp;values. However, spline area series help &laquo;smooth&raquo; individual lines that connect data points. In&nbsp;this example, you can switch between the _spline area_, _stacked spline area_ and _full-stacked spline area_ series types. _Stacked spline area_ series help visualize multiple series and compare the manner in&nbsp;which each series contributes to&nbsp;the total aggregate value for specific arguments. _Full-stacked spline area_ series help compare the percentage value of&nbsp;multiple spline area series for each argument.
