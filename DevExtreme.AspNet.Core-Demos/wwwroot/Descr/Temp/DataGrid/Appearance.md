The **DataGrid** has been created with an&nbsp;intention to&nbsp;look simple and informative. However, you can change the visibility of&nbsp;column and row lines as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;use row alternation to&nbsp;reach the most appropriate appearance for your task. In&nbsp;this demo, you can spot the difference between various grid appearances by&nbsp;enabling and disabling the **showBorders**, **showColumnLines**, **showRowLines** and **rowAlternationEnabled** options.
