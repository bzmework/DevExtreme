The **DataGrid** widget includes a&nbsp;comprehensive set of&nbsp;appearance and behavior customization options for individual grid columns. In&nbsp;this example, column selection, reordering, resizing and fixed columns are enabled and the following custom settings have been applied: custom alignment has been set for the _Position_ column; a&nbsp;calculated value is&nbsp;displayed for the _Employee_ column. The _Employee_ column is&nbsp;also anchored to&nbsp;the grid&rsquo;s left edge, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;always displayed in&nbsp;the grid regardless of&nbsp;horizontal scrolling. You can disable the fixed column or&nbsp;fix a&nbsp;different column within the grid container using the column header&rsquo;s context menu.
