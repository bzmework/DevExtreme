The **DataGrid** widget supports deferred row selection. When it&nbsp;is&nbsp;enabled, the **DataGrid** does not make requests for data until this is&nbsp;demanded from the API. In&nbsp;this demo, data is&nbsp;loaded when the jQuery Deferred object returned by&nbsp;the **getSelectedRowsData()** method is&nbsp;resolved. To&nbsp;specify initially selected rows, the **selectionFilter** option is&nbsp;used. Use deferred selection mode when working with a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;remote data.
