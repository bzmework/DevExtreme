The **DataGrid** can hide columns according to&nbsp;the specified priority if&nbsp;screen width is&nbsp;not enough to&nbsp;display all of&nbsp;them. The hiding priority is&nbsp;specified using the **hidingPriority** field of&nbsp;an&nbsp;item in&nbsp;the **columns** array. Switch between the landscape and portrait layouts to&nbsp;see how the **DataGrid** looks on&nbsp;wide and narrow screens.
