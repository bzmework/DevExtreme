The **DataGrid** widget allows you to&nbsp;group column headers logically to&nbsp;implement a&nbsp;banded layout. In&nbsp;this demo, the **columns** array has a&nbsp;hierarchical structure, although such a&nbsp;layout can be&nbsp;built on&nbsp;a&nbsp;flat-structured array as&nbsp;well. Note that despite being banded, the nested columns remain interactive.
