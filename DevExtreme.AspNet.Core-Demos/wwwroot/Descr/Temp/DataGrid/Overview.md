DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Data Grid is a jQuery-powered server-side control packed with a great variety of features including binding to data from Web API and MVC controllers, record grouping, filtering and sorting, row selection, and many more. Data Grid supports strongly-typed HTML helpers, which supplies it with client-side validation based on Data Annotations by default. You can choose between Razor C\# and Razor VB syntax and use lambda expressions when configuring it.
