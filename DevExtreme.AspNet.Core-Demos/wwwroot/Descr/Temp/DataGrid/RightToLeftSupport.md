The **DataGrid** fully support RTL languages. As&nbsp;is&nbsp;illustrated in&nbsp;this demo, the **DataGrid** widget is&nbsp;able to&nbsp;display its contents in&nbsp;a&nbsp;right-to-left direction and fully mirror associated&nbsp;UI elements. Use the language drop-down menu (change from English to&nbsp;Arabic) to&nbsp;explore the differences between default and RTL modes available in&nbsp;DevExtreme.
