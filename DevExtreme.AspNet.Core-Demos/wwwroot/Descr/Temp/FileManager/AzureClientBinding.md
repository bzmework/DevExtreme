This demo illustrates how to use the custom file provider to connect the **FileManager** widget to the Azure Blob Storage on the client side. The [Custom File Provider](/Documentation/19_2/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/File_Providers/Custom) allows you to implement custom APIs to handle file operations (add, delete, rename, etc.). On the server, configure the [Shared Access Signature (SAS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) to grant access to blobs in the storage.
