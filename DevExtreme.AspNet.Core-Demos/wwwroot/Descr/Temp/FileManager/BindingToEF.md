The **File Manager** widget allows you to manage file system items that use the Entity Framework ORM to link to a database. You can use the [Remote File Provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/File_Providers/Remote) to connect to the file system on the client side. To process the widget's HTTP requests on the server, create your own file provider, which implements the [IFileProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.IFileProvider) interface.
