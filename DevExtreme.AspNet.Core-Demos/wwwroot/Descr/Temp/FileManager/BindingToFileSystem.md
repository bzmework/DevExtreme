The **File Manager** widget can work with a file system located on the server. To connect the widget with the file system items, assign the [Remote File Provider](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/File_Providers/Remote/) to the fileProvider option. Pass the [endpoint url](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileManager/File_Providers/Remote/Configuration/#endpointUrl) to the remote file provider object to specify the Url at which the widget can access the file system items.

Configure the built-in server-side helper methods to process the FileManager widget's AJAX requests on the ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core backend.
1. Create an instance of the [FileSystemConfiguration](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.FileSystemConfiguration) class to create a file provider and configure its interaction with file system items.
2. Use the [FileSystemProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.FileSystemConfiguration.FileSystemProvider) property to specify a file system provider. For a physical file system, configure a file provider of the [DefaultFileProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.DefaultFileProvider) type.
3. Use the [FileSystemCommandProcessor](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/DevExtreme.AspNet.Mvc.FileManagement.FileSystemCommandProcessor) class to process commands and request parameters that the widget passes to the file system.

This demo contains commented out code lines that enable file modification operations. You can uncomment them and configure if necessary.
