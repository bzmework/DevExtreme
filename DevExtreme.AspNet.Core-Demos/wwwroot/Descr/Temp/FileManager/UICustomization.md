The **File Manager** widget provides the following UI customization options:

* The **toolbar** option specifies the toolbar's visibility and available commands.
* The **contextMenu** option specifies the context menu's availability and its commands.

The toolbar and context menu support context-invariant and context-sensitive items that can be visible or hidden depending on user action.
