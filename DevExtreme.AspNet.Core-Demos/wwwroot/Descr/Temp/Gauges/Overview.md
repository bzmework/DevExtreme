DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Gauges are jQuery-powered server-side controls for visualizing data on dashboards. They come in two geometric shapes - circular, or radial, and linear - and provide a comprehensive set of features including multiple animated value indicators, geometry customization, interactive tooltips, palettes support, and many more. You can choose between Razor C\# and Razor VB syntax and use lambda expressions when configuring gauges.
