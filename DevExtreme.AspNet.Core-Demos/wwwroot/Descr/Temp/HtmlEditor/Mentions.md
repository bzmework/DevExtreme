The **HtmlEditor** allows a user to mention other users in the text. Users that can be mentioned are suggested in a drop-down list that gets its items from the [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/mentions/#dataSource).

The suggestion list appears when a user enters a specific [marker](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/mentions/#marker). To mention a user, enter `@` in the text field at the bottom and select the user from the list.

Data for mentions can be from multiple data sources. In this case, you can assign an individual marker to each of them.
