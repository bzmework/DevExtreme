DevExtreme HTML5 JavaScript HTML Editor is&nbsp;a&nbsp;client-side WYSIWYG text editor that allows its users to&nbsp;format textual and visual content and store it&nbsp;as&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;or Markdown. In&nbsp;this demo, the editor&rsquo;s content provides a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;supported features. You can edit it&nbsp;using the [toolbar](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/toolbar/) that consists entirely of&nbsp;built-in controls. In addition, you can [resize images](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/mediaResizing/).
