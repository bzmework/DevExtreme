This example demonstrates how to&nbsp;define recurring appointments. You can specify the appointment repetition interval programmatically or&nbsp;in&nbsp;the UI. In&nbsp;the former case, the appointment object should contain the **recurrenceRule** field. In&nbsp;the latter case, toggle the **Repeat** switcher on&nbsp;the appointment details form to&nbsp;mark the appointment as&nbsp;recurring and specify the required fields.
