DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Tree List is a jQuery-powered control for displaying hierarchical data. Its key features include: data binding to Web API and MVC controllers, data shaping, editing and validation, virtual scrolling, and many more. Tree List supports strongly-typed HTML helpers, which supplies it with client-side validation based on Data Annotations by default. You can choose between Razor C\# and Razor VB syntax and use lambda expressions when configuring it.
