This example demonstrates editing in _&laquo;row&raquo;_ mode. Each row is&nbsp;supplied with an _&laquo;Edit&raquo;_ link, a&nbsp;click on&nbsp;which switches the row into the editing state. Editors vary from one cell to&nbsp;another: they may be&nbsp;calendars, select boxes, simple text boxes, etc. Note that you can also add or&nbsp;delete a&nbsp;row using the _&laquo;Add a&nbsp;row&raquo;_ button or&nbsp;the _&laquo;Delete&raquo;_ link, respectively.
