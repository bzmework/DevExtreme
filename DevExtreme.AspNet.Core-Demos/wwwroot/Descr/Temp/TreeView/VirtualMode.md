For working with a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;data, the **TreeView** widget provides the Virtual Mode. In&nbsp;this mode, the widget loads a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;child nodes once their parent node is&nbsp;expanded. In&nbsp;this demo, the **TreeView** is&nbsp;associated with a&nbsp;remote data source. Note that the widget shows a&nbsp;loading indicator, because data loading takes a&nbsp;long time.
