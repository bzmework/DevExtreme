DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Maps are jQuery-powered server-side controls for creating GPS navigation maps and vector maps in your app. The Map control supports Google Maps and Bing Maps providers, provides roadmap, satellite, and hybrid views, and allows a user to create markers and routes. The Vector Map control ships with several predefined data sources, supports multiple legends, zooming, and colorization. You can choose between Razor C\# and Razor VB syntax and use lambda expressions when configuring these controls.
