DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Tree List is a jQuery-powered server-side control packed with a great number of features including data shaping, data editing and validation, searching and filtering, layout customization, etc. Tree List supports strongly-typed HTML helpers, which supplies it with client-side validation based on Data Annotations by default. You can configure it using Razor C\# or Razor VB syntax, and it can be used in MVC views as well as in Razor Pages (introduced in .NET Core 2.0).
