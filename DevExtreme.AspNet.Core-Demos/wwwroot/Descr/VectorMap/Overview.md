DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Maps is a pair of interactive jQuery-powered server-side controls for mapping. The Map control works with data from Google Maps and Bing Maps, provides several views, and allows a user to create custom markers and routes. The Vector Map control ships with several predefined data sources (but works with a custom one as well), supports zooming, colorization, multiple legends and marker types. You can configure both the controls with Razor C\# or Razor VB syntax and using lambda expressions. In addition, DevExtreme ASP.NET Core MVC Gauges can be used in Razor Pages (introduced in .NET Core 2.0).
